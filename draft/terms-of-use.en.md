**An Authorized User:**
 An Authorized User is a person who the customer or someone with admin access on the customer's account has been invited to participate in the customer's account.



**Services :**

# Agreement to Terms.

**You agree to these Terms by creating an account or purchasing a subscription.**

If you create an account to access the Service or you agree to purchase a Subscription, you are agreeing to these Terms as Customer. When you accept an invitation to join a team or organization account created by Customer, or you agree to these Terms, you also agree to be bound by these Terms as an Authorized User on Customer’s subscription.

Either way, you represent and warrant:

If a customer cancels their subscription, Company will not refund any of the money that was prepaid before. All payments are to be made in US dollars, and the customer has to maintain credit card information up-to-date. Customers agree to pay the Company on the specified frequency for using their service. Companies will charge late fees if payments are not made on time and can suspend or downgrade an account if they need to.


The service allows users to share content with others, such as text, files, documents, graphics, images, music, software and more. Anything that is not Feedback is referred to as User Content. Company does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any of your rights, including any intellectual property or moral rights that you may have in your User Content.
