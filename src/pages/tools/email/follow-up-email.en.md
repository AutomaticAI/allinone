# Email generator: follow-up emails

Follow-up emails are usually sent after a customer makes a purchase or signs up for your newsletter. This type of email is used to thank you for the purchase and remind them about your company. With this type of follow-up email, you can ask for feedback about their experience with your company – but only if they’ve already had some kind of interaction with you first!


## The Benefits of Follow-Up Emails for Your Business


Follow-up emails are an effective way to nurture relationships with customers. The goal of follow-up emails is to keep your customers engaged and build loyalty, which is an important part of any long-term marketing strategy. Follow-up emails also help you retain more customers and increase sales, which is why they’re so valuable to businesses.
