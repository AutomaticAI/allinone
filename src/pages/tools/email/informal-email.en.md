Email is ubiquitous in our lives - at work and at home. We utilize it to stay in touch with friends and family, coordinate with colleagues, and handle a variety of tasks big and small. But for all its usefulness, writing a good email can be tough. It can be hard to know how to open an email, what to include in the body, or how to sign off. Plus, it can be tricky to find the right tone and keep the email friendly. With so many potential pitfalls, it's no wonder that so many of us find email to be a daunting task.
