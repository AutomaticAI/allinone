## Understanding Value Propositions

In Short : A company's value proposition is the number one reason why their product or service is best suited for that particular customer. A value proposition should be communicated to customers directly, either on the company's website or through other marketing materials. The value proposition should be persuasive and help turn a prospect into a paying customer.

A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It's the primary reason a prospect should buy from you. It's also the #1 thing that determines whether people will bother reading more about your product or hit the back button.
A value proposition can make or break your marketing. It's the difference between a signup and a bounce, a purchase and an abandoned cart. A value proposition is the #1 thing that determines whether people will bother reading more about your product.
For a product or service to be successful, it must provide value to the customer that exceeds the cost of obtaining the product. Value propositions are the method by which companies communicate the value of their product to potential consumers. The purpose of a value proposition is to concisely express the benefits that customers can expect from a company's product or service.
The best value propositions are clear, precise, and convey the benefits of the product or service over its competition. Consumers are overwhelmed by the number of products and services that are available to them in modern society. Value propositions are the means by which companies can differentiate themselves from others and communicate their unique benefits to consumers.

## Components of a Value Proposition

This kind of structure allows consumers to scan the value proposition quickly and pick up on product features. Added visuals increase the ease of communication between business and consumer. In order to craft a strong value proposition, companies will often conduct market research to determine which messages resonate the best with their customers.

Value propositions generally have three components:

1. Product features
2. Customer benefits
3. Differentiation

Product features are the physical characteristics of a product or service. They are the specs that can be measured, such as size, weight, speed, capacity, and so on. Customer benefits are the value that the customer derives from the product features. They are the emotional appeal of the product, such as the feeling of safety, the satisfaction of a job well done, or the enjoyment of a pleasurable experience. Differentiation is what sets your product or service apart from the competition. It is the unique value that you offer that your competitors do not.
A strong value proposition will communicate all three of these components clearly and concisely. It will be easy for the customer to understand what they will get from your product and why it is better than the alternatives.

Here is an example of a value proposition that does a good job of expressing all three components:

"Our product is the only one on the market that is made of 100% recycled materials. It is also the lightest and strongest in its class, so you can be sure that it will last long. And because we care about the environment, we offer a full refund if you are not satisfied with the product."
